     <p className="textabout">Dance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the 
     accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed in time to such music. Some dance (such as tap dance) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of 
      traditional dance/music couplings include the jig, waltz, tango, disco, and salsa.
       Some musical genres have a parallel dance form such as baroque music and baroque
        dance; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature 
     but developed separately, such as classical music and classical ballet.</p>
